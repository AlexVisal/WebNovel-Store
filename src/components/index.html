        <p>Jaehwan was a normal person who was buying chips at his local convenience store. Suddenly, weird towers appeared across the globe, summoning people within. Jaehwan accepted the summons, witnessed monsters decimate his homeworld, and prevailed against the 100 levels and their respective boss monsters. At the end, he realized the Tower was an illusion, and that humanity was never destroyed. Now he fights against the people who created the Towers, which are cultivation methods for the Gods and the Lords. As he fights them all, Jaehwan swears to destroy the system and the world that wronged him.

            His final enemy is Big Brother, the master of the System itself.</p>
